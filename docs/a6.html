        This page documents Assignment 1: Blink. The goal of this assignment
        was to design a circuit with multiple LEDs, write Arduino firmware to make
        them blink independently, and explain the design decisions behind the circuit.

    <p>
      This schematic shows the Arduino connected to three LEDs, each with its own
      resistor. Separate digital pins are used so that each LED
      can be controlled independently.

    <p>
      This image shows the physical implementation of the circuit on a breadboard.
      Each LED is placed in series with a resistor, and all components share a common
      ground connected to the Arduino.

    <h2>Arduino Firmware</h2>
    <p>
      Below is the Arduino code used to blink each LED independently. Each line of
      code is commented to explain its function.
    </p>
    <pre>
<code>
// Define the pin number for the first LED
int led1 = 13;

// Define the pin number for the second LED
int led2 = 12;

// Define the pin number for the third LED
int led3 = 11;

void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin led1 as an output.
  pinMode(led1, OUTPUT);
    // initialize digital pin led2 as an output.
  pinMode(led2, OUTPUT);
    // initialize digital pin led3 as an output.
  pinMode(led3, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(led1, HIGH);  // turn the first LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(500);                      // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(led1, LOW);   // turn the first LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(200);                      // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(led2, HIGH);  // turn the second LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(300);                      // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(led2, LOW);   // turn the second LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(200);                      // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(led3, HIGH);  // turn the third LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(led3, LOW);   // turn the third LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(50);

    <h2>Circuit Operation</h2>
    <img src="a1gif.gif" />
    <p>
      This animated GIF demonstrates the circuit in operation. Each LED blinks at
      a different rate, showing that they are controlled independently.
    </p>

    <!-- ===================== -->
    <h2>Voltage vs. Time Graph</h2>
    <img src="a1graph.webp" />
    <p>
      This graph shows voltage across each LED over time. When an LED is on, the
      voltage rises to its forward voltage, and when off, the voltage drops to zero.
      Each LED has a distinct timing pattern.
    </p>

    <h2>Additional Questions</h2>

    <h3>How many LEDs could you blink independently?</h3>
    <p>
      10 LEDs safely blinking independently using an Arduino Uno, with a current 
      of ~20mA per LED and appropriate resistors to limit current. This results in 
      a total current draw of around 200mA, which is within the Arduino's limits.
    </p>
    <br><br>

    <h3>How fast must LEDs blink before blinking is no longer visible?</h3>
    <p>
      Due to testing I preformed with different blink rates, I found that
      it would require blinking every 0.004 seconds (4 milliseconds) for the
      blinking to no longer be visible to the human eye.
